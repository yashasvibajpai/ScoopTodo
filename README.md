# ScoopTodo
A simple to-do app, designed to implement the interconnected working of Django in backend, while React in frontend


After simple cloning, both django-server and react server need to be independently started on different ports.
To allow unification into a single port:
1. CD into the frontend portion.
2. Run npm install
3. Run npm run build
4. Now the app will start on port 8000, the default port for django.
(Please configure the settings,py to suit your specific needs.)
